## About
A simple bookmark extension for Mozilla Firefox. This is just for personal use.
I want my bookmarks to be on a dropdown menu instead on the bookmark field.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation
To install the dependencies, just execute `npm install`

## Building
Before you can load the extension, you will need to build the project first.
You can do this in three different ways:

```bash
# Will build it once
npm run build

# To build in production
npm run build:p

# Or if you are developing
npm run build:w
```

## Testing
To test the application then execute `npm test`.
